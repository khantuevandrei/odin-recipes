    <h1>Turkey meatballs</h1>
    <img src="../images/meatballs.jpg" alt="A picture of a cooked meatballs">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nigella's turkey meatballs are light and succulent, as well as being lower in fat. Make a batch – half for tea and half to be frozen for future outings.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g/1lb 2oz turkey mince</li>
        <li>1 free-range egg</li>
        <li>3 tbsp breadcrumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For the meatballs, put all the ingredients for the meatballs, including the reserved chopped onion and celery, and salt according to preference, into a large bowl and gently mix together with your hands. Don’t overmix, as that will make the meatballs dense-textured and heavy.</li>
        <li>Drop the meatballs gently into the simmering sauce; I try to let these fall in concentric circles working round the pan from the outside edge inwards, in the vaguest of fashions.</li>
        <li>Let the meatballs simmer in the sauce for 30 minutes, or until cooked through. Serve with rice, pasta, couscous or however you so please.</li>
